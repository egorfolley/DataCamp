'''
In this exercise, we expand beyond binary classification to cover multiclass problems. A multiclass problem has targets that can take on three or more values. In the credit card dataset, the education variable can take on 6 different values, each corresponding to a different level of education. We will use that as our target in this exercise and will also expand the feature set from 3 to 10 columns.

As in the previous problem, you will define an input layer, dense layers, and an output layer. You will also print the untrained model's predictions, which are probabilities assigned to the classes. The tensor of features has been loaded and is available as borrower_features. Additionally, the constant(), float32, and keras.layers.Dense() operations are available.

# Construct input layer from borrower features
inputs = constant(borrower_features, float32)

# Define first dense layer
dense1 = keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid')(inputs)

# Define second dense layer
dense2 = keras.layers.Dense(8, activation='relu')(dense1)

# Define output layer
outputs = keras.layers.Dense(6, activation='softmax')(dense2)

# Print first five predictions
print(outputs.numpy()[:5])
