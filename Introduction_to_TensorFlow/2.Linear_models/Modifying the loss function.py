'''
In the previous exercise, you defined a tensorflow loss function and then evaluated it once for a set of actual and predicted values. In this exercise, you will compute the loss within another function called loss_function(), which first generates predicted values from the data and variables. The purpose of this is to construct a function of the trainable model variables that returns the loss. You can then repeatedly evaluate this function for different variable values until you find the minimum. In practice, you will pass this function to an optimizer in tensorflow. Note that features and targets have been defined and are available. Additionally, Variable, float32, and keras are available.

# Initialize a variable named scalar
scalar = Variable(1.0, 'float32')

# Define the model
def model(scalar, features = features):
  	return scalar * features

# Define a loss function
def loss_function(scalar, features = features, targets = targets):
	# Compute the predicted values
	predictions = model(scalar, features)
    
	# Return the mean absolute error loss
	return keras.losses.mae(targets, predictions)

# Evaluate the loss function and print the loss
print(loss_function(scalar).numpy())
