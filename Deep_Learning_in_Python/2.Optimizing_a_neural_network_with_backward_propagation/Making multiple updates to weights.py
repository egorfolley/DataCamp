'''
You're now going to make multiple updates so you can dramatically improve your model weights, and see how the predictions improve with each update.

To keep your code clean, there is a pre-loaded get_slope() function that takes input_data, target, and weights as arguments. There is also a get_mse() function that takes the same arguments. The input_data, target, and weights have been pre-loaded.

This network does not have any hidden layers, and it goes directly from the input (with 3 nodes) to an output node. Note that weights is a single array.

We have also pre-loaded matplotlib.pyplot, and the error history will be plotted after you have done your gradient descent steps.

n_updates = 20

# Iterate over the number of updates
for i in range(n_updates):
    # Calculate the slope: slope
    slope = get_slope(input_data, target, weights)
    
    # Update the weights: weights
    weights = weights - 0.01 * slope
    
    # Calculate mse with new weights: mse
    mse = get_mse(input_data, target, weights)
    
    # Append the mse to mse_hist
    mse_hist.append(mse)
