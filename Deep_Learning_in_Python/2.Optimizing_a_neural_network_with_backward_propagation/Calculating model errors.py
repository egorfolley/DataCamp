For the exercises in this chapter, you'll continue working with the network to predict transactions for a bank.

What is the error (predicted - actual) for the following network when the input data is [3, 2] and the actual value of the target (what you are trying to predict) is 5? It may be helpful to get out a pen and piece of paper to calculate these values.
