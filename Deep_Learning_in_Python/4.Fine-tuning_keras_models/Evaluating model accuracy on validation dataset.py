'''
Now it's your turn to monitor model accuracy with a validation data set. A model definition has been provided as model. Your job is to add the code to compile it and then fit it. You'll check the validation score in each epoch.

# Save the number of columns in predictors: n_cols
n_cols = predictors.shape[1]
input_shape = (n_cols,)

# Specify the model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu', input_shape = input_shape))
model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(2, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Fit the model
hist = model.fit(predictors, target, validation_split=.3)
