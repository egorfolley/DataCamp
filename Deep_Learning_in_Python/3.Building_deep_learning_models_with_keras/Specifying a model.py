Now you'll get to work with your first model in Keras, and will immediately be able to run more complex neural network models on larger datasets compared to the first two chapters.

To start, you'll take the skeleton of a neural network and add a hidden layer and an output layer. You'll then fit that model and see Keras do the optimization so your model continually gets better.

As a start, you'll predict workers wages based on characteristics like their industry, education and level of experience. You can find the dataset in a pandas dataframe called df. For convenience, everything in df except for the target has been converted to a NumPy matrix called predictors. The target, wage_per_hour, is available as a NumPy matrix called target.

For all exercises in this chapter, we've imported the Sequential model constructor, the Dense layer constructor, and pandas.

# Import necessary modules
import keras
from keras.layers import Dense
from keras.models import Sequential

# Save the number of columns in predictors: n_cols
n_cols = predictors.shape[1]

# Set up the model: model
model = Sequential()

# Add the first layer
model.add(Dense(50, activation='relu', input_shape=(n_cols,)))

# Add the second layer
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))

# Add the output layer
model.add(Dense(1))
