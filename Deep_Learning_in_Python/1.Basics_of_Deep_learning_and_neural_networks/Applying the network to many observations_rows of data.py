'''
You'll now define a function called predict_with_network() which will generate predictions for multiple data observations, which are pre-loaded as input_data. As before, weights are also pre-loaded. In addition, the relu() function you defined in the previous exercise has been pre-loaded.

# Define predict_with_network()
def predict_with_network(input_data_row, weights):

    # Calculate node 0 value
    node_0_input = (input_data_row * weights['node_0']).sum()
    node_0_output = relu(node_0_input)

    # Calculate node 1 value
    node_1_input = (input_data_row * weights['node_1']).sum()
    node_1_output = relu(node_1_input)

    # Put node values into array: hidden_layer_outputs
    hidden_layer_outputs = np.array([node_0_output, node_1_output])
    
    # Calculate model output
    input_to_final_layer = (hidden_layer_outputs * weights['output']).sum()
    model_output = relu(input_to_final_layer)
    
    # Return model output
    return(model_output)


# Create empty list to store prediction results
results = []
for input_data_row in input_data:
    # Append prediction to results
    results.append(predict_with_network(input_data_row, weights))

# Print results
print(results)
