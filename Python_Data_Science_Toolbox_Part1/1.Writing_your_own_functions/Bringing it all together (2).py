'''
Great job! You've now defined the functionality for iterating over entries in a column and building a dictionary with keys the names of languages and values the number of tweets in the given language.

In this exercise, you will define a function with the functionality you developed in the previous exercise, return the resulting dictionary from within the function, and call the function with the appropriate arguments.

For your convenience, the pandas package has been imported as pd and the 'tweets.csv' file has been imported into the tweets_df variable.

# Define count_entries()
def count_entries(df, col_name):
    """Return a dictionary with counts of 
    occurrences as value for each key."""

    # Initialize an empty dictionary: langs_count
    langs_count = {}
    
    # Extract column from DataFrame: col
    col = df[col_name]
    
    # Iterate over lang column in DataFrame
    for entry in col:

        # If the language is in langs_count, add 1
        if entry in langs_count.keys():
            langs_count[entry] += 1
        # Else add the language to langs_count, set the value to 1
        else:
            langs_count[entry] = 1

    # Return the langs_count dictionary
    return langs_count

# Call count_entries(): result
result = count_entries(tweets_df, 'lang')

# Print the result
print(result)
