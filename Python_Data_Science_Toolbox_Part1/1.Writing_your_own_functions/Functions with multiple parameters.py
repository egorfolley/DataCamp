'''
Hugo discussed the use of multiple parameters in defining functions in the last lecture. You are now going to use what you've learned to modify the shout() function further. Here, you will modify shout() to accept two arguments. Parts of the function shout(), which you wrote earlier, are shown.

# Define shout with parameters word1 and word2
def shout(word1, word2):
    """Concatenate strings with three exclamation marks"""
    # Concatenate word1 with '!!!': shout1
    shout1 = word1 + '!!!'
    
    # Concatenate word2 with '!!!': shout2
    shout2 = word2 + '!!!'
    
    # Concatenate shout1 with shout2: new_shout
    new_shout = shout1 + shout2

    # Return new_shout
    return new_shout

# Pass 'congratulations' and 'you' to shout(): yell
yell = shout('congratulations', 'you')

# Print yell
print(yell)
