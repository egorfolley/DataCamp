'''
To check if two Python values, or variables, are equal you can use ==. To check for inequality, you need !=. As a refresher, have a look at the following examples that all result in True. Feel free to try them out in the IPython Shell.

2 == (1 + 1)
"intermediate" != "python"
True != False
"Python" != "python"
When you write these comparisons in a script, you will need to wrap a print() function around them to see the output.

# Comparison of booleans
True == False

# Comparison of integers
-5 * 15 != 75

# Comparison of strings
"pyscript" == "PyScript"

# Compare a boolean with an integer
True == 1
