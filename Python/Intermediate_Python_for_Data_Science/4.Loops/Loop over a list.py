Have another look at the for loop that Filip showed in the video:

fam = [1.73, 1.68, 1.71, 1.89]
for height in fam :
    print(height)
As usual, you simply have to indent the code with 4 spaces to tell Python which code should be executed in the for loop.

The areas variable, containing the area of different rooms in your house, is already defined.

'''


# areas list
areas = [11.25, 18.0, 20.0, 10.75, 9.50]

# Code the for loop
for i in areas:
    print(i)
