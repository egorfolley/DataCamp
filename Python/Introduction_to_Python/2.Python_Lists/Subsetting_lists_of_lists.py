You saw before that a Python list can contain practically anything; even other lists! To subset lists of lists, you can use the same technique as before: square brackets. Try out the commands in the following code sample in the IPython Shell:

x = [["a", "b", "c"],
     ["d", "e", "f"],
     ["g", "h", "i"]]
x[2][0]
x[2][:2]
x[2] results in a list, that you can subset again by adding additional square brackets.

What will house[-1][1] return? house, the list of lists that you created before, is already defined for you in the workspace. You can experiment with it in the IPython Shell.
