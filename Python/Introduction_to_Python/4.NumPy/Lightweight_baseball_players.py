'''
To subset both regular Python lists and numpy arrays, you can use square brackets:

x = [4 , 9 , 6, 3, 1]
x[1]
import numpy as np
y = np.array(x)
y[1]
For numpy specifically, you can also use boolean numpy arrays:

high = y > 5
y[high]
The code that calculates the BMI of all baseball players is already included. Follow the instructions and reveal interesting things from the data!

# height and weight are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Create the light array
light = bmi < 21

# Print out light
print(light)

# Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[light]
