'''
Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as:

Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4**2 will give 16.
Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4.
The code in the script on the right gives some examples.
'''


# Addition, subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication, division, modulo, and exponentiation
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)
print(18 % 7)
print(4 ** 2)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100 * ( 1.1 ** 7) )
