'''
Strings come with a bunch of methods. Follow the instructions closely to discover some of them. If you want to discover them in more detail, you can always type help(str) in the IPython Shell.

A string place has already been created for you to experiment with.

# string to experiment with: place
place = "poolhouse"

# Use upper() on place: place_up
place_up = place.upper()

# Print out place and place_up
print(place, place_up)

# Print out the number of o's in place
print(place.count('o'))
