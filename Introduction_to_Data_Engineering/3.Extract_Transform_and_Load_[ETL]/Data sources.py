In the previous video you've learned about three ways of extracting data:

Extract from text files, like .txt or .csv
Extract from APIs of web services, like the Hackernews API
Extract from a database, like a SQL application database for customer data
We also briefly touched upon row-oriented databases and OLTP.

Can you select the statement about these topics which is not true?
