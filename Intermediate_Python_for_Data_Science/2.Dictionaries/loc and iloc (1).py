'''
With loc and iloc you can do practically any data selection operation on DataFrames you can think of. loc is label-based, which means that you have to specify rows and columns based on their row and column labels. iloc is integer index based, so you have to specify rows and columns by their integer index like you did in the previous exercise.

Try out the following commands in the IPython Shell to experiment with loc and iloc to select observations. Each pair of commands here gives the same result.

cars.loc['RU']
cars.iloc[4]

cars.loc[['RU']]
cars.iloc[[4]]

cars.loc[['RU', 'AUS']]
cars.iloc[[4, 1]]
As before, code is included that imports the cars data as a Pandas DataFrame.

'''


# Import cars data
import pandas as pd
cars = pd.read_csv('cars.csv', index_col = 0)

# Print out observation for Japan
print(cars.iloc[2])

# Print out observations for Australia and Egypt
print(cars.loc[['AUS','EG']])
