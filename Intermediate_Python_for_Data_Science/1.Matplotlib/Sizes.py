'''
Right now, the scatter plot is just a cloud of blue dots, indistinguishable from each other. Let's change this. Wouldn't it be nice if the size of the dots corresponds to the population?

To accomplish this, there is a list pop loaded in your workspace. It contains population numbers for each country expressed in millions. You can see that this list is added to the scatter method, as the argument s, for size.

'''


# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Store pop as a numpy array: np_pop
np_pop = np.array(pop)

# Double np_pop
np_pop = np_pop * 2

# Update: set s argument to np_pop
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp, np_pop)

# Previous customizations
plt.xscale('log')
plt.xlabel('GDP per Capita [in USD]')
plt.ylabel('Life Expectancy [in years]')
plt.title('World Development in 2007')
plt.xticks([1000, 10000, 100000],['1k', '10k', '100k'])

# Display the plot
plt.show()
