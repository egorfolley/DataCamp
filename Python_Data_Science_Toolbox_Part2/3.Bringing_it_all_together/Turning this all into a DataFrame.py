'''
You've zipped lists together, created a function to house your code, and even used the function in a list comprehension to generate a list of dictionaries. That was a lot of work and you did a great job!

You will now use of all these to convert the list of dictionaries into a pandas DataFrame. You will see how convenient it is to generate a DataFrame from dictionaries with the DataFrame() function from the pandas package.

The lists2dict() function, feature_names list, and row_lists list have been preloaded for this exercise.

Go for it!

# Import the pandas package
import pandas as pd

# Turn list of lists into list of dicts: list_of_dicts
list_of_dicts = [lists2dict(feature_names, sublist) for sublist in row_lists]

# Turn list of dicts into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.DataFrame(list_of_dicts)

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())
