You know how to use zip() as well as how to print out values from a zip object. Excellent!

Let's play around with zip() a little more. There is no unzip function for doing the reverse of what zip() does. We can, however, reverse what has been zipped together by using zip() with a little help from *! * unpacks an iterable such as a list or a tuple into positional arguments in a function call.

In this exercise, you will use * in a call to zip() to unpack the tuples produced by zip().

Two tuples of strings, mutants and powers have been pre-loaded.

'''


# Create a zip object from mutants and powers: z1
z1 = zip(mutants, powers)

# Print the tuples in z1 by unpacking with *
print(*z1)

# Re-create a zip object from mutants and powers: z1
z1 = zip(mutants, powers)

# 'Unzip' the tuples in z1 by unpacking with * and zip(): result1, result2
result1, result2 = zip(*z1)

# Check if unpacked tuples are equivalent to original tuples
print(result1 == mutants)
print(result2 == powers)
