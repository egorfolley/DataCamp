'''
You know that list comprehensions can be built over iterables. Given the following objects below, which of these can we build list comprehensions over?

doctor = ['house', 'cuddy', 'chase', 'thirteen', 'wilson']

range(50)

underwood = 'After all, we are nothing more or less than what we choose to reveal.'

jean = '24601'

flash = ['jay garrick', 'barry allen', 'wally west', 'bart allen']

valjean = 24601

# You can build list comprehensions over all the objects except the integer object valjean.
