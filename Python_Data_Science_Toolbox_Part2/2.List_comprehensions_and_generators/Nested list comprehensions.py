Great! At this point, you have a good grasp of the basic syntax of list comprehensions. Let's push your code-writing skills a little further. In this exercise, you will be writing a list comprehension within another list comprehension, or nested list comprehensions. It sounds a little tricky, but you can do it!

Let's step aside for a while from strings. One of the ways in which lists can be used are in representing multi-dimension objects such as matrices. Matrices can be represented as a list of lists in Python. For example a 5 x 5 matrix with values 0 to 4 in each row can be written as:

matrix = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]
Your task is to recreate this matrix by using nested listed comprehensions. Recall that you can create one of the rows of the matrix with a single list comprehension. To create the list of lists, you simply have to supply the list comprehension as the output expression of the overall list comprehension:

[[output expression] for iterator variable in iterable]

Note that here, the output expression is itself a list comprehension.

# Create a 5 x 5 matrix using a list of lists: matrix
matrix = [[col for col in range(5)] for row in range(5)]

# Print the matrix
for row in matrix:
    print(row)
